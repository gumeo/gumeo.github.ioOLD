      <description>Start of a small series The gif below is the evolution of the weights from a neural network trained on the mnist dataset. Mnist is a dataset of handwritten digits, and is kind of the hello world/FizzBuzz of machine learning. It is maybe not a very challenging data set, but you can learn a lot from it. This is a 10 by 10 grid of images, where each individual small patch represents weights going to a single neuron in the first hidden layer of the network.</description>

      <description>What is a strange attractor? The wikipedia article on attractors gives the following definition/explanation:
 An attractor is called strange if it has a fractal structure. This is often the case when the dynamics on it are chaotic, but strange nonchaotic attractors also exist. If a strange attractor is chaotic, exhibiting sensitive dependence on initial conditions, then any two arbitrarily close alternative initial points on the attractor, after any of various numbers of iterations, will lead to points that are arbitrarily far apart (subject to the confines of the attractor), and after any of various other numbers of iterations will lead to points that are arbitrarily close together.</description>

      <description>Starting a blog The plan is to try to do weekly to monthly blogposts about something interesting I learn. I might also write up technical details about setting something up as a reference for my future self.
I chose to use the blogdown package to manage this blog, with the hugo theme purehugo. The main reason I chose this is because I think it scales well for mobile devices and it looks clean and minimal.</description>
