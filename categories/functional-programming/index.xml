      <description>Start of a small series So I received the Deep Learning book a little more than a month ago, and I have had time to read parts I and II. I think that overall the authors successfully explain and condense a lot of research into something digestable. The reason why I use the word condense is because how much information the book contains. The bibliography is 55 pages, so I almost feel that the book should be called Introduction to Deep Learning Research, because it is a gateway to so much good material.</description>
