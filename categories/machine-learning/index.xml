      <description>Letâ€™s go on! If you just arrived, you can check out the first part here. The goal of this series is to demonstrate how compactly we can implement an MLP in a functional programming paradigm and how easy it becomes to extend/play around with it. This post is aimed at the R person that wants to get into deep learning or anyone curious about how these things are implemented. Another goal is to visualize what is happening in a neural network during training in hope to get a deeper understanding of what is going on.</description>

      <description>Start of a small series The gif below is the evolution of the weights from a neural network trained on the mnist dataset. Mnist is a dataset of handwritten digits, and is kind of the hello world/FizzBuzz of machine learning. It is maybe not a very challenging data set, but you can learn a lot from it. This is a 10 by 10 grid of images, where each individual small patch represents weights going to a single neuron in the first hidden layer of the network.</description>

      <description>Starting a blog The plan is to try to do weekly to monthly blogposts about something interesting I learn. I might also write up technical details about setting something up as a reference for my future self.
I chose to use the blogdown package to manage this blog, with the hugo theme purehugo. The main reason I chose this is because I think it scales well for mobile devices and it looks clean and minimal.</description>
