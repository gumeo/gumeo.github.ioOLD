      <description>Start of a small series So I received the Deep Learning book a little more than a month ago, and I have had time to read parts I and II. I think that overall the authors successfully explain and condense a lot of research into something digestable. The reason why I use the word condense is because how much information the book contains. The bibliography is 55 pages, so I almost feel that the book should be called Introduction to Deep Learning Research, because it is a gateway to so much good material.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Strange Attractors </title>

      <description>What is a strange attractor? The wikipedia article on attractors gives the following definition/explanation:
 An attractor is called strange if it has a fractal structure. This is often the case when the dynamics on it are chaotic, but strange nonchaotic attractors also exist. If a strange attractor is chaotic, exhibiting sensitive dependence on initial conditions, then any two arbitrarily close alternative initial points on the attractor, after any of various numbers of iterations, will lead to points that are arbitrarily far apart (subject to the confines of the attractor), and after any of various other numbers of iterations will lead to points that are arbitrarily close together.</description>

      <description>Starting a blog The plan is to try to do weekly to monthly blogposts about something interesting I learn. I might also write up technical details about setting something up as a reference for my future self.
I chose to use the blogdown package to manage this blog, with the hugo theme purehugo. The main reason I chose this is because I think it scales well for mobile devices and it looks clean and minimal.</description>
